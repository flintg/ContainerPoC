This repository is a collection of proof-of-concept applications in the Clarion programming language to run in Docker on Windows.

This will help me (and maybe you) figure out how to run NetTalk Web Server apps and others in Docker.  Containers are the future of app infrastrusture, so Clarion developers need to get up to speed.
